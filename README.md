## the idea
Wouldn't it be fun to be able to prank your haxxor friends if they are crazy enough to leave their computer unlocked without being worried that you might break their setup?


## shellpranks to the rescue
We aim to create a collection of safe pranks that you can install on your friends computer just by running a `curl -sL https://shellpranks.io/prank.sh | bash`. 

## our moto
1. pranks should be safe
1. pranks should funny
1. each prank should have a score between 0 - 7 based on how pranky it is
1. one computer should not be able to run pranks that total above 7 points
1. prank can only run `(7 - prank score)`  days
1. pranks should be contained in `~/.shellpranks`
